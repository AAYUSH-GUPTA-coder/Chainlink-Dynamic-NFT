A dynamic NFT is a non-fungible token that can change based on certain circumstances.
I have build a Dynamic NFT using Chainlink’s decentralized and cryptographically secured oracle network to get and track asset price data.
Also, use Chainlink Keepers Network to automate NFT smart contract to update the NFTs according to the asset price data

If the market price moves up, the smart contract will randomly pick the NFT’s URI to point to one of these three bullish images and the NFT will be dynamically updated:

Finally, I have used Chainlink’s Verifiable Random Function to add cryptographically guaranteed randomness to our NFT smart contract to randomly select an NFT image from a list of options.
